## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **Hackdex**, a platform that allows users to download and apply patches to their legally obtained ROM files.
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data in compliance with the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** and other applicable privacy laws.

By using Hackdex, you agree to this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Service](https://hackdex.app/terms).

---

## 2. Data We Collect

### Anonymous Users
For visitors who browse and download patches without creating an account, Hackdex generates a **unique device ID** stored in your browser's localStorage.
This ID:
- Is used **solely to prevent download-count abuse**.
- Does **not** contain personally identifiable information.
- Is **reset** if your browser cache is cleared.

Additionally, for each download, we record:
- The **patch ID**
- The **time of download**
- The **generated device ID** (for count verification only)

No other data is collected from anonymous users.

### Creators (Registered Users)
When you create a creator account to upload ROM hacks, we collect:
- **Name**
- **Email address**
- **Username**

This data is necessary to create and manage your account and public creator profile.

---

## 3. Purpose of Processing

| User Type | Purpose of Data Use |
|------------|--------------------|
| Anonymous Users | To ensure download count accuracy and prevent abuse. |
| Creators | To create, manage, and display creator profiles; to authenticate access to the platform. |

We do **not** use personal data for marketing, profiling, or advertising purposes.

---

## 4. Legal Basis for Processing

We process your data based on:
- **Legitimate interest** (for anonymous users, to maintain fair and accurate download metrics)
- **Contractual necessity** (for creators, to provide account-related functionality)
- **Consent** (when you voluntarily create an account and accept the Privacy Policy)

---

## 5. How We Obtain Consent

By creating a creator account on Hackdex, you explicitly agree to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.
Anonymous users are not required to consent separately since only non-identifiable technical data is used for functionality.

---

## 6. Cookies & Local Storage

Hackdex uses limited browser storage technologies for essential functionality only.

### Local Storage
For **anonymous users**, a unique device ID is stored in the browser's **localStorage**.
This ID:
- Helps ensure download counts remain accurate and fair.
- Does **not** identify or track you personally.
- Is automatically reset if you clear your browser cache.

### Cookies
For **creators (registered users)**, we use **authentication cookies** provided by Supabase.
These cookies:
- Are required for login sessions and secure access to creator features.
- Are used **only for authentication and authorization** purposes.
- Are **not** used for analytics, tracking, or advertising.

Because these cookies and localStorage entries are strictly necessary for platform functionality, user consent for them is not required under GDPR Article 6(1)(f).

---

## 7. Data Retention

- **Anonymous Users:** Download data (such as patch IDs and timestamps) is stored in our database for aggregate and statistical purposes. While this data remains stored, it cannot be linked back to any individual once the user clears their browser's localStorage, as the unique device ID used for download tracking is then removed.
- **Creators:** Personal data is retained as long as your account remains active or until you request its deletion.

---

## 8. Data Sharing and Third Parties

Hackdex uses **Supabase** as its backend service provider for authentication and database storage.
Supabase processes user data **solely on behalf of Hackdex** and in accordance with GDPR requirements.

- **Service:** Supabase
- **Hosting Location:** Ohio, USA
- **Purpose:** Authentication, database, and storage
- **Safeguards:** Supabase implements industry-standard security and complies with GDPR through data processing agreements and encryption.

Hackdex does not share or sell personal data to any other third parties.

---

## 9. International Data Transfers

Because Supabase servers are hosted in the **United States**, your data may be transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
Supabase applies **appropriate safeguards**, such as **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)**, to ensure that your data remains protected and processed lawfully.

---

## 10. Security Measures

We take the security of your data seriously. Hackdex employs:
- **SSL encryption** for all data transmissions
- **Password hashing** to protect account credentials
- **Restricted database access** using Row-Level Security (RLS) and user roles
- Regular internal reviews of access permissions

- **Right to rectification:** Correct inaccurate or incomplete data.
